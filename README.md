#My 1st Personal Portfolio Website, will be updated soon!

It's an old-school website, usual web-developing tools, no effects whatsoever. I'm not so much bothered for now.
Excellent Retro-Designing CSS Framework - https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css
May not be exactly 90's old-school, ah well...

PHP (that's right, I use PHP, and I like it too!) part script to be added soon, although until it is properly hosted, it's dummy script...
