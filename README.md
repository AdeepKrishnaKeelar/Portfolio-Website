My 1st Personal Portfolio Website, will be updated soon!

It's an old-school website, usual web-developing tools, no effects whatsoever. I'm not so much bothered for now.
Excellent Retro-Designing CSS Framework - https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css

May not be exactly 90's old-school, ah well...

PHP (that's right, I use PHP, and I like it too!) part script to be added soon, although until it is properly hosted, it's dummy script...

(DISCLAIMER - See it only on your system, don't be surprised if it doesn't render there... only brave people with steel guts check the site on their mobile devices... It looks worse than a tornado hit constrcution site...)
